Introduction
============

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication
issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask
people to adhere to. This code applies equally to founders, mentors, members and
those seeking help and guidance.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in
the spirit in which it’s intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of
us and the communities in which we participate.

Code of Conduct
===============

*	Be friendly and patient.

*	Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will
	depend on the work of others. Any decision you take will affect users and
	colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making
	decisions. Remember that you might not be communicating in someone else's
	primary language.

*	Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no
	excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some
	frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into
	a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people
	feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one.

*	Be careful in the words that you choose. Be kind to others. Do not insult or
	put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior
	aren't acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
	-	Violent threats or language directed against another person.
	-	Discriminatory language.
	-	Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
	-	Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying
		information.
	-	Personal insults.
	-	Unwelcome sexual attention.
	-	Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
	-	Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop,
		then stop.

*	When we disagree, try to understand why. Disagreements happen all the time.
	It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views
	constructively. Remember that we’re different. Our strength comes from its
	varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people
	have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why
	someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that
	it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t get us anywhere. Instead,
	focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

Scope
=====

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

Reporting
=========

If you are subject to unacceptable behavior, you may notify a community
organizer by emailing <conduct@errlock.org>.

If you believe anyone is in physical danger, please notify appropriate law
enforcement first. If you are unsure what law enforcement agency is appropriate,
please include this in your report and we will attempt to notify them.

In your report please include:
-	Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you)
-	Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
	were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
-	When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
-	Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g.
	a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger) please include a link.
-	Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
-	If you believe this incident is ongoing.
-	Any other information you believe we should have.

You will receive an answer aknowledging the receipt of your report as soon as
possible.

Discussion
==========

After discussing it with the reporter, and in the interest of transparency, the
report, and the discussion about it, may be made public.

In the event of any conflict of interest a community organizer must immediately
notify the discussion, and recuse themselves.

The report will be discussed, including the individual(s) involved, until a
consensus is reached on the action to be taken, or immediate action is deemed
necessary.

The report, and the discussion about it, will be archived.

Consequences
============

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those
with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers
may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban
or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in
the case of a paid event).

If the incident involves physical danger, any authorized member will act
immediately to protect safety. This can include contacting law enforcement.

Grievances
==========

If you feel you have been falsely or unfairly accused of violating this Code of
Conduct, you should notify <conduct@errlock.org> with a concise description of
your grievance. Your grievance will be handled in accordance with the present
document.
